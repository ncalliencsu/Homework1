    "text": "Question 1 - what do you think being a data scientist is all about?\nAnswer - the classical definition of a scientist is someone who uses the scientific method as the cornerstone of their work. By way of review, the scientific method consists of:\n\nDefine Question\nForm Hypothesis\nGather Data\nAnalyze Data\nTest Hypothesis\nDraw Conclusions\nPublish Results\n\nScientists propose and test a hypothesis about some aspect of the physical world by gathering and analyzing data, followed by publishing conclusions and results. The classical scientist is interested in discovering the workings of the physical world. In contrast, the data scientist is interested in finding answers to questions related to business processes. In summary, data science is the discipline of practicing the scientific method to data generated by business processes.\nQuestion 2 - what differences / similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nAnswer - the data scientist and statistician have in common that they are interested in what conclusions can be drawn from data. The data scientist will generally work on large data sets to answer broad reaching questions relevant to business processes. In contrast, the statistician will generally work on smaller data sets to answer questions of a limited scope that will generally not be related to a business process. The data scientists brings models to the data, whereas the statistician brings data to models.\nQuestion 3 - how do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?\nAnswer - my work in industry has been almost exclusively as an industrial statistician (without the official title). I worked on small data sets seeking to answer questions of a limited scope. Examples are the application of statistics to test method validation and design verification in the medical device industry.\nQuarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
